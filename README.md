# DevilEngine üòà

## Overview

My 3D Engine built with OpenGL, providing graphics rendering with raytracing and editing.

## Features

- **Graphics Rendering**: Render 3D scenes with various meshes, textures and shadow mapping.üëæ
- **Blinn Phong Lighting**: Utilize directional, point, and spot lights for realistic lighting effects.üí°
- **Editor**: Gizmos, OX plane, ImGui integration and much more...‚å®Ô∏è
- **Raytracing**: Non-realtime bvh raytracing for advanced rendering, with refraction, reflection and texture support.üåü
- **Serialization**: Provide scene serialization to load and save scenes dynamically.‚úèÔ∏è

## Planned Next Features

- **Rendering**: Currently implementing GPU instancing for performances improvement.
- **Physics**: Integrate physics simulation for realistic interactions.
